# Flappy-Learner-report
The first three weeks mainly consisted of theorotical part and covered the basics of core machine learning concepts.

First week was mainly about intro to ML. It covered mainly overview of Artificial Intelligence and its subfields, differences between AI, ML, and RL, types of ML, etc. 

Second week was about introduction to Neural Networks, theory topics like Gradient Descent, Model Evaluation, etc were covered.

Week three was Markov Decision Processes it covered topics like Markov Chains, MDP, Value Fuctions, Beliman Equations, etc

The refernces provided are awesome and helped me a lot in solidifying these theorotical concepts. Looking forward to apply these fundamentals into the final Flappy Bird project.

After learning Monte Carlo (MC) Methods, Sarsa, Q=learning i was able to implemet sarsa and Q-learning on gridworld, by the end of week 5.

Week 6 started with Deep Q-Network(DQN), Policy Gradient Methods and PPO and was mostly focussed on learning with not much coding.

Project releated work was started on week 7, for which I spent significant amount of time making my own flappy bird game which later i replaced with another refined version.
By the end of week 7 the game code was modified accordingly such that RL agent can be incorporated in it.

From week 8 till this date I spent time working on RL, it was very challenging, and had to use AI to solve problems in the code. 

At the end the RL agent is able to play game for several minutes without losing thanks to training of hours.
