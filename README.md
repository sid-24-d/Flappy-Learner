# Flappy-Learner-report
The first three weeks mainly consisted of theorotical part and covered the basics of core machine learning concepts.

First week was mainly about intro to ML. It covered mainly overview of Artificial Intelligence and its subfields, differences between AI, ML, and RL, types of ML, etc. 

Second week was about introduction to Neural Networks, theory topics like Gradient Descent, Model Evaluation, etc were covered.

Week three was Markov Decision Processes it covered topics like Markov Chains, MDP, Value Fuctions, Beliman Equations, etc

The refernces provided are awesome and helped me a lot in solidifying these theorotical concepts. Looking forward to apply these fundamentals into the final Flappy Bird project.
